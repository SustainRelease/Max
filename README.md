# Navailis Project Management Tool
A tool for managing the workflow on boat-engineering projects. Authorized engineers and clients can log into the portal to see the status of projects, confirm approval of project designs, and share design documents. Furthermore, each engineer has their own personal page which includes reviews of projects they have worked on.
